# PandaETL Project

This repository now includes **SplitMate**, a simple React Native app that helps friends split restaurant bills using receipt images. The original ETL components remain in `src/`.

See `splitmate/README.md` for instructions on running the mobile app or launching it in a web browser via Expo.
